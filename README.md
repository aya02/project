A QR decomposition of a matrix using the orthogonal Householder transformation.

A square matrix A is decomposed as
  A = QR
where Q is an orthogonal matrix and R is an upper triangular matrix.

The main.py file creates a random matrix A and returns Q and R.


To execute
```
python execute.py
```
You can change the size of matrices in execute.py file (now it is n=5).
